           <li>I started playing soccer at a very young age maybe when I was 6 or 7. Soccer is the one thing that calms me down and makes me a happier person.
           It is my main sport and I love playing the sport. It reduces the stress in my life and I play for a club team named Impact United and we are premier 1
           which is really good. I like soccer because it gives me a challenge and I always can get better and learn something new each day. I have played some other
           sports in my life and soccer is the one sport that has stuck with me and I like the most. My goal with soccer is to make it to a D1 college and hopefully go
           professional. The club that I support is Manchester City and they play in the Preimer League and is a pro team. My favorite player is David Beckham but he 
           is retired. I am going to tryout for the highschool team and go on from there to make my dreams come true. I have lots of passion for the game and can't
           wait to represent Skyline's men's soccer team!</li>
