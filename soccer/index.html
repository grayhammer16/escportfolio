         <li>Soccer</li>
           <li>I started playing soccer at a very young age maybe when I was 6 or 7.</li>
           <li>Soccer is the one thing that calms me down and makes me a happier person.</li>
           <li>It is my main sport and I love playing the sport and it reduces the stress in my life.</li> 
           <li>I play for a club team named Impact United and we are premier 1, which is really good.</li>
           <li>I like soccer because it gives me a challenge and I always can get better and learn something new each day.</li>
           <li>I have lots of passion for the game.</li>
           <li>My goal with soccer is to make it to a D1 college and hopefully go professional.</li>
           <li>The club that I support is Manchester City and they play in the Preimer League and is a pro team.</li>
           <li>My favorite player is David Beckham but he is retired.</li>
           <li>I am going to tryout for the highschool team and go on from there to make my dreams come true.</li>
